I am certified professional with substantial experience in end to end implementation of a Data Project from Data Strategy, building the infrastructure, implementing data pipelines up until getting value on the data through the use of Analytics and Data Science. I lead teams and implemented projects in different industries such as telco, finance, retail, and utilities. I helped various clients get insights from existing data as well as external data in different data formats providing impactful business value and actionable insights to the company. I also love trying new things, so feel free to reach out for any new data science projects!
